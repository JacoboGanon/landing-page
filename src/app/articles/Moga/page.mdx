Moga is a gymnastics gym where I first found the need for a gym management software in Mexico.
However, the owners where only looking for a management software for classes and product inventory and this is the problem I solved with this application.

## Classes and Inventory

This application was based on local storage and was only available on the owner's computer.
It helped manage the class schedule, and the gym's inventory.

The clients had to be added manually and register the information that could be used for emergencies.
When a student had a class and their time was close to expiration the owner and client would get a notification.

For the inventory the owner could add products and see the quantity of each product.
When a product was sold the owner could update the quantity and see the total sales for the day.

## Features.

- **Classes**: The owner could add, delete, and update classes.
- **Inventory**: The owner could add, delete, and update products.
- **Clients**: The owner could add, delete, update clients, and add time to them.
- **Notifications**: The owner and client would get a notification when a class was close to expiration.
- **Expiration Portal**: The owner could see the clients that had classes close to expiration in an easy to use portal.
- **Format Data**: Format the data and download in an excel.

## Technology Stack

- Python, TKinter, Pandas, Email-Mime, Openpyxl.

## Conclusion and Demo

This project was a great way to start my career in software development, and look for the needs in the market.
To get a demo of this project contact 22jacganon@gmail.com to setup a meeting and see the software.
A better version of this software is available at [Caliza](/articles/Caliza),
as it is a software I developed later to fully adapt to the needs of the clients instead of only what they ask for.
