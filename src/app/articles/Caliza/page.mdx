Caliza is a gymnastics, and bouldering gym located in Mexico. There is little software to help manage gyms in Mexico,
and the software that does exist is often outdated and difficult to use. In Caliza I worked to create a gym
software with the owners that would help manage everything in the gym and later sold it to other gyms.

It helps manage the class schedule, the gym's members, the gym's inventory, and the gym's finances. It also helps the gym's members and parents track their progress and see how they are improving over time.

## Customizability

One of the most important features of the software is its customizability.
The software is designed to be easily customizable so that it can be used by any gym, not just Caliza.
The software can be easily customized to fit the needs of any gym, no matter how big, small, or the activities that it supports.

The gym's can change the price of classes, create discounts for students, set the activities that the gym offers with
the corresponding progression plans, and many other customizable features.

## Features

- Students have the ability to change change the classes they are taking as long as there are
  available slots and it is in the same level they are currently in.

- Payments can be done online with a one time payment or subscription model
  and the system will automatically update the student's status.

- The system tracks the inventory of sold items and the gym's finances with any payments done in the gym or online.

- QRCodes to enter the gym and track the student's and employee attendance.

- Employee section where they can see their schedule, the classes they are teaching, and the students they are in charge of.

- Authentication and authorization portal with different roles for the administrators, employees, and students.

- Many more features that help the gym run smoothly and efficiently.
